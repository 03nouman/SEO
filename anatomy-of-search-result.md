Anatomy of search results: Influence how your site looks in Google Search
-text results or blue links:
- which contain one title link and snippet description
- title link is most prominent part of the search result that jumps out as soo as search result.
- title links are generated based on the content of your page.
- same as snippet task is created based on the page content, if page content is not available than it  won't appear.
- we can also control the snippets whether to show or not. also we can say no-snippet to particular page content="nosnippets" with name=robots meta tag and max content in snippet content="max-snippets:[number]"
- Also we can set no-snippet on particular page element <span data-nosnippets>.........</span>
- The other text results are attribution result, which are favicon of your site and the site name, including breadcrumb.
- we can influence this in various ways, changing the url might change the breadcrumb. chaging structure data might change your sight name and changing the favicon will update the favicon in google search results.
- In the snippets itself, we can say byline date when the site last updated or published.
