* Indexing:  The way google understand what the page is about and determining  some signals that will help us decide  whether  we should index the page.
- Indexing includes  processing  and analyzing the textual content, key content tags,  attributes, images, videos, and calculating  signals that google can use to rank  the pages in its search results.
- There some process,
1. Google parses: the HTML and fixes  any semantic issues, it may have encountered. This will make sure that all the HTML tags  are in the right place and where they need to be. Once the HTML is formatted,
2. Google determines:  if the page is duplicate of another know page, and which version should kept in the index, the canonical version.
canonical version: canonical version is the page  from a group of  duplicate pages that best represent the  group  according to the signals we've collected about each version. once the google  has the content  of your page  or more specifically the main contents  or centerpiece  of a page, it will  group it  with one or more pages  featuring the similar content, if any.
This is duplicate clustering: then  it compares  a handful of  signals  it has already calculated  for each page to select a canonical version.

note:- for the most part  only canonical pages appears in search results

signals: signals  are pieces of  information  that a search engines  collects about pages,  and websites, which are  used for further processing. some signals are straight forward  such as  site owner orientations as html, like "rel=canonical", while others like  the importance  of an individual page on the internet

- each of the duplicate cluster will have single  version of  the content  selected as canonical. This version will represent in search results for all the other versions, The other version becomes alternate versions, that may be served in different context, like if user is searching  for a very specific  page  from the cluster.

3. Index selection: Once the  signals are collected and duplicates dropped, Google decides whether or not to index the page. This process is called index selection.
- It largely depends on the quality of the page and the signals that we're previously collected.
- If canonical page does get indexed, then we store the information that we collected about it and the cluster in the google index.
- Google index technically is just a large  databases sitting on thousands of computers.
- However, it returns  results highly relevant to whatever we are asking, it will done by serving mechanism.
