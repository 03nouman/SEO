*Serving: How google actually serves ad rank the results.
- when we enter a query in google search, the search engines machines search index for the matching pages and return results we believe are the highest quality trustworthy and most relevant to your query.
- Retrieval of the results begins with interpreting the query:
1. first, the query is cleaned up, then checked for certain entities. For e.g, the query " a nice photography of the moon ", doesn't require the stops words like "a","of","the" and so we'll scrub those out. However " The statue of liberty" does require of, so we'll leave it in. Additionally the "statue of liberty" is recognized  as it own entity.
- The query will also be expanded  to include similar words. for example, searching  " car dealership" will expand to include  "auto dealership" becoz cars and auto are close synonyms.

2. Once we understand the query, we can send  it to index: Based on parsed query, the index will return a large  umber of results that will need to be ranked.

3. ranking: Ranking largely depends on the relevancy  of the results  to the user.
- Hundreds of  factors determines relevance, with the actual contents of the  page being the most importance one, but also things like user's location, language and device type. for example. searching for " bicycle repair shops", shows different results to a user in Paris than the user in hong kong.
- also we'll likely see  local results and no  image results, more likely searching for modern bicycle is likely to show image results instead of  local results.
- we also need to take quality of the page  and the site into consideration during ranking.
- Quality is determined by number of factors, like uniqueness of the content, the relative importance of the page on the internet, and a lot more, for more detail on how we determine and think about  quality i general,
- Based on the search query, the search features  that appear on the  search result pages may also  change.
