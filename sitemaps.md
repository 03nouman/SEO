four main ways to provide information:
1. images: url extensions, we can extend url with images included init.
2. videos: url extensions, we can extend url with videos included init.
3.laguage/country versions- hreflang annotations, we can include information about alternate language or coutry versions with href annotations
4. recent-updates(new sites)- sitemap variation, for new sites we can use  a special variation of sitemaps to give us  information about the most  recents updates

A sitemap might be  especially helpful if:
- your site is really large
- your pages are isolated, like pages are ot link properly
- your site is new/  changes quickly.
